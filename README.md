# Ada Array Index Out of Bounds

This example demonstrates an Ada program with an array index out of bounds error.  It shows how exceeding the bounds of an array can lead to runtime errors. The solution demonstrates how to fix the issue and ensure safe array access.

**Problem:**
The original code attempts to access array elements outside of the valid range, causing a runtime error.

**Solution:**
The solution carefully checks that the index is within the valid bounds of the array before accessing the element. This prevents runtime errors and ensures program stability.
